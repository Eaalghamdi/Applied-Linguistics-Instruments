## Animacy Judgment

The task is used to assess speed of lexical access. Participants are presented with some word stimuli and are prompted to decide, as fast as possible, whether words identified either a living (e.g., dog) or nonliving (e.g., chair) item by pressing either the right or left shift key on the computer keyboar (Segalowitz & Frenkiel-Fishman, 2005).
